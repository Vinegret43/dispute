**The Damn Stylish Pomodoro Timer**

Designed to get better productivity while staying healthy and motivated

# Features
ðŸŽ¯ Simple and strict: there is no pause button or ability to skip a round.
Dispute contains only what you really need to actually get work done

âœ¨ Clean, yet beautiful and unique UI design with animations and sound effects

ðŸ’» Dispute can hide its window and quietly sit in your tray. Just launch it
again to re-open the window

ðŸ¦€ <s>Written in Ru</s> Is this even a feature in the modern day?

### From source
Note that, when built on UNIX, Dispute requires QT to be installed on your
system

To compile and install Dispute from source, run these commands in the
following order:
```sh
git clone "https://github.com/Vinegret43/dispute"
cd dispute
# May take a while, so be patient
cargo build --release
# You don't have to copy it to ~/.local/bin, any directory which is in
# your $PATH should be fine
cp target/release/dispute ~/.local/bin
# Installs desktop files so you can launch Dispute from your app launcher.
# UNIX-only
dispute --install
```
